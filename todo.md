- make configs available in json and scss and less
- fvDatepicker from-to
- fvDatepicker time
- create root class named .fv-framevuerk-root with html, body and set it to <html> just if method Framevuerk.avtive() called.
othervise, fvMain injection to childrens fallback to default value that is a on air component that has all fvMain methods, but affects directly to body. (for those who want to need native body scrollbar and custom layouts and no need to fvMain and fvContent as root elemenets)
